# Moataz AI — Enterprise Project Foundation & Blueprints

Welcome to the foundation of **Moataz AI**, a production-grade, enterprise-scale AI SaaS Platform designed to unify connections to multiple AI providers under a single, highly performant, and secure portal. This repository contains the complete modular architecture skeletons, configuration files, and system designs.

| **Styling & UI** | Tailwind CSS / Framer Motion | Fluid animations, styling, and RTL/LTR interfaces. |
| **Relational Storage**| Supabase PostgreSQL | Transactional workspace and configuration data. |
| **Transient Storage** | Redis | Caching, rate limiting, and BullMQ queues backing. |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant | RAG similarity vectors and semantic memory. |
| **File Storage** | Supabase Storage | Document bucket systems for OCR and RAG ingestion. |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry / Sentry / PostHog | Dynamic performance trace tracking and monitoring. |

## Hybrid Modular Clean Architecture

To support codebases exceeding 500,000 lines of code, Moataz AI implements a **Hybrid Architecture** combining:
1.  **Feature-Based Modules**: Grouping logic by business domain (e.g. Chat, Workspace, Brain) to keep files cohesive.
2.  **Clean Architecture**: Splitting each feature module internally into `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, and `presentation` layers to decouple business logic from delivery mechanisms.
3.  **Core Systems Isolation**: Core services like Events Bus, Queue pipelines, and encryption vaults reside under `src/core/`.
